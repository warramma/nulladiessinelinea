    <h2>binary search</h2>
    <p>halving and halving a sorted list.</p>
    <p>100 numbers, takes you 7 tries to guess the number I'm thinking of...why?</p>
    <p>Rambling: log base 2 (100)? how many powers of 2 in 100? 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 108. ah, so 7 ish halves in 100.</p>

    <h3>binary search practice</h3>

    <h4> exercises </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take? - log base 2 of 128 which isss exactly 7 steps!!</li>
        <li>Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now? - 8! (2^7 * 2)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Big O! </h3>
    <p>worst case scenario.</p>
    <h4>exercises</h4>
    <p>Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of big O.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have a name, and you want to find the person's phone number in the phone book - log(n)</li>
        <li> You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name in the phone book.  - linear time</li>
        <li>You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book. - linear time</li>
        <li>You want to read the numbers of just the As. - n/26 time so n time (no constants)</li>
    </ol>
